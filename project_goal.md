I want to create a fake store that staff at my business can use to trade a fake currency in exchange for company swag.

I want this to be a webpage capable of being hosted on an apache2 webserver using mariadb.

I want the webpage to use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want it to use a modern layout with a clean sleek design and a light color theme with blue accents.

I need the following:

Ability for users to log in and check their account balance.

Ability for users to add items to their cart and checkout. Checking out should reduce the appropriate amount of currency from their balance and send their order as an email to a specific email address.

Ability for administrators to login and add currency to user balances.

Ability to easily add new items to be sold.
